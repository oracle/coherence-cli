== Federation

=== Overview
There are various commands that allow you to work with and issue Federation commands.

* <<get-federation, `cohctl get federation`>> - displays federation details for a cluster
* <<start-federation, `cohctl start federation`>> - starts federation for a service
* <<stop-federation, `cohctl stop federation`>> - stops federation for a service
* <<pause-federation, `cohctl pause federation`>> - pauses federation for a service
* <<replicate-all, `cohctl replicate all`>> - initiates a replicate of all cache entries for a federated service

NOTE: This is a Coherence Grid Edition feature only and is not available with Community Edition.

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/administer/federating-caches-clusters.html[Coherence Documentation] for
more information on Federation.

[#get-federation]
==== Get Federation

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/get_federation.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Display all destinations.

NOTE: Destinations are clusters that this cluster is sending data to.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get federation destinations -c local

SERVICE         DESTINATION        MEMBERS  STATES    DATA SENT  MSG SENT  REC SENT  CURR AVG BWIDTH
FederatedCache  secondary-cluster        2  [PAUSED]        0MB         0         0          0.0Mbps
----

Display all destinations in wide format.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get federation destinations -c local -o wide

SERVICE         DESTINATION        MEMBERS  STATES  DATA SENT  MSG SENT  REC SENT  CURR AVG BWIDTH  AVG APPLY  AVG ROUND TRIP  AVG BACKLOG DELAY  REPLICATE  PARTITIONS  ERRORS  UNACKED
FederatedCache  secondary-cluster        2  [IDLE]      204MB     1,028     3,348          0.0Mbps      338ms         1,393ms           37,770ms    100.00%          31       0        0
----

Using the wide option, the following fields are available in regard to the current (or latest) replicate all operation:

1. REPLICATE - the percent complete for the request
2. PARTITIONS - the total number of partitions completed for the request
3. ERRORS - the number of partitions with error responses for the request
4. UNACKED - the total number of partitions that have been sent but have not yet been acknowledged for the request

NOTE: The last three attributes are only available in the latest Commercial and CE patches. Check your release notes.

Display all origins.

NOTE: Origins are clusters that this cluster is receiving data from.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get federation destinations -c local

cohctl get federation origins -c local

SERVICE         ORIGIN             REMOTE CONNECTIONS  DATA REC  MSG REC  REC REC
FederatedCache  secondary-cluster                   2  20MB          755    2,577
----

Display all origins in wide format.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get federation origins -c local -o wide

SERVICE         ORIGIN             REMOTE CONNECTIONS  DATA REC  MSG REC  REC REC  AVG APPLY  AVG BACKLOG DELAY

[#start-federation]
==== Start Federation

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/start_federation.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Start Federation for all participants.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl start federation FederatedCache -c local

Are you sure you want to start federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

Start Federation for a specific participant.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl start federation FederatedCache -p secondary-cluster -c local

Are you sure you want to start federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

Start Federation for a specific participant with no backlog.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl start federation FederatedCache -p secondary-cluster -m no-backlog -c local

Are you sure you want to start (no-backlog) federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

[#stop-federation]
==== Stop Federation

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/stop_federation.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Stop Federation for all participants.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl stop federation FederatedCache -c local

Are you sure you want to stop federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

Stop Federation for a specific participant.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl stop federation FederatedCache -p secondary-cluster -c local

Are you sure you want to start federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

[#pause-federation]
==== Pause Federation

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/pause_federation.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Pause Federation for all participants.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl pause FederatedCache -c local

Are you sure you want to pause federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

[#replicate-all]
==== Replicate All

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/replicate_all.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Replicate all for a specific participant

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl replicate all FederatedCache -p secondary-cluster -c local

Are you sure you want to replicateAll federation for service FederatedCache for participants [secondary-cluster] ? (y/n) y
operation complete
----

NOTE: When this command returns, the replicate all request has been sent to the cluster but may not yet be complete.
You should use the command `cohctl get federation destinations -o wide` to show the replication percent complete.
