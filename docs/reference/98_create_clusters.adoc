= Creating Clusters

== Creating Clusters

=== Overview
There are various cluster commands that allow you to create and work with local development based clusters.

These commands allow you to create local only development based clusters (scoped to localhost) for Coherence CE 22.06.x and
Commercial 14.1.1.2206.x versions and above.

Once you create a local cluster, you can manage and monitor them in the same way as you can with discovered
or manually added clusters.

When you create a cluster, the first node started will always have management over REST enabled.

You may also specify a profile when you start a cluster using the `-P` option. The value of the profile
, which is a string containing "-Dkey=value" pairs, will be included in the cache servers started.

NOTE: These commands are experimental only and may be changed or removed in the future. It is *not supported* to use
these commands to create production clusters.

* <<create-cluster, `cohctl create cluster`>> - creates a local cluster and adds to the cohctl.yaml file
* <<scale-cluster, `cohctl scale cluster`>> - scales a cluster that was manually created
* <<stop-cluster, `cohctl stop cluster`>> - stops a cluster that was manually created or started
* <<start-cluster, `cohctl start cluster`>> - starts a cluster that was manually created
* <<start-console, `cohctl start console`>> - starts a console client against a cluster that was manually created
* <<start-cohql, `cohctl start cohql`>> - starts a CohQL client against a cluster that was manually created
* <<start-class, `cohctl start class`>> - starts a specific Java class against the local Coherence cluster
* <<set-default-heap, `cohctl set default-heap`>> - sets default heap for creating and starting clusters
* <<get-default-heap, `cohctl get default-heap`>> - gets default heap for creating and starting clusters
* <<clear-default-heap, `cohctl clear default-heap`>> - clears default heap for creating and starting clusters
* <<set-profile, `cohctl set profile`>> - set a profile value for creating and starting clusters
* <<remove-profile, `cohctl remove profile`>> - removes a profile value from the list of profile
* <<get-profils, `cohctl get profiles`>> - displays the profiles that have been created

NOTE: By default, Coherence CE groupId is used and the version is {coherence-version}. You can change this via using `-C` for commercial and `-v` to change the Coherence version.

NOTE: Additional dependencies `coherence-json` is included to enable Management over REST and `jline` is included for `CohQL` history support.

Add and start a commercial Coherence cluster (14.1.1.2206.1) and set initial memory for each cluster to 1g and use active persistence mode.
