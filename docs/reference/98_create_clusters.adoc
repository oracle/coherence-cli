= Creating Clusters

== Creating Clusters

=== Overview
There are various cluster commands that allow you to create and work with local development based clusters.

These commands allow you to create local only development based clusters (scoped to localhost) for Coherence CE 22.06.x and
Commercial 14.1.1.2206.x versions and above.

Once you create a local cluster, you can manage and monitor them in the same way as you can with discovered
or manually added clusters.

NOTE: These commands are experimental only and may be changed or removed in the future. It is *not supported* to use
these commands to create production clusters.

* <<create-cluster, `cohctl create cluster`>> - creates a local cluster and adds to the cohctl.yaml file
* <<stop-cluster, `cohctl stop cluster`>> - stops a cluster that was manually created or started
* <<start-cluster, `cohctl start cluster`>> - starts a cluster that was manually created
* <<start-console, `cohctl start console`>> - starts a console client against a cluster that was manually created
* <<start-cohql, `cohctl start cohql`>> - starts a CohQL client against a cluster that was manually created

*Examples*

Add and start a cluster using all default values.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]]
----
$ cohctl create cluster local

Cluster name:         local
Cluster version:      {coherence-version}
Cluster port:         7574
Management port:      30000
Server count:         3
Initial memory:       512m
Persistence mode:     on-demand
Group ID:             com.oracle.coherence.ce

----

NOTE: By default, Coherence CE groupId is used and the version is {coherence-version}. You can change this via using `-C` for commercial and `-v` to change the Coherence version.

NOTE: Additional dependencies `coherence-json` is included to enable Management over REST and `jline` is included for `CohQL` history support.

Add and start a commercial Coherence cluster (14.1.1.2206.1) and set initial memory for each cluster to 1g and use active persistence mode.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl create cluster local -C -v 14.1.1-2206-1 -M 1g -P active -S

Cluster name:         local
Cluster version:      14.1.1-2206-1
Cluster port:         7574
Management port:      30000
Server count:         3
Initial memory:       1g
Persistence mode:     active
Group ID:             com.oracle.coherence

NOTE: In this example we are using the `-S` option to skip downloading maven artifacts as we know they are already installed locally.

Add and start a cluster using all default values but include additional `coherence-rest` and opentracing dependencies.
