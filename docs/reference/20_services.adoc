=== Overview
There are various commands that allow you to work with and manage cluster services.

* <<get-services, `cohctl get services`>> - displays the services for a cluster
* <<describe-service, `cohctl describe service`>> - shows information related to a specific service
* <<start-service, `cohctl start service`>> - starts a specific service on a cluster member
* <<stop-service, `cohctl stop service`>> - forces a specific service to stop on a cluster member
* <<shutdown-service, `cohctl shutdown service`>> - performs a controlled shut-down of a specific service on a cluster member
* <<set-service, `cohctl set service`>> - sets a service attribute across one or more members

[#get-services]
==== Get Services

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/get_services.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

Display all services.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get services -c local
----

Display all services of type `DistributedCache`

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get services -c local -t DistributedCache
----

Watch all services of type `DistributedCache`

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get services -c local -t DistributedCache -w
----

Wait for all services of type `DistributedCache` to become `MACHINE-SAFE`.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get services -c local -t DistributedCache -w -a MACHINE-SAFE
----

[#describe-service]
==== Describe Service

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/describe_service.adoc[tag=text]

----
$ cohctl describe service PartitionedCache -c local
----

[#start-service]
==== Start Service

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/start_service.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl start service PartitionedCache -n 1 -c local

Are you sure you want to perform start for service PartitionedCache on node 1? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

[#stop-service]
==== Stop Service

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/stop_service.adoc[tag=text]

*Examples*

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl stop service PartitionedCache -n 1 -c local

Are you sure you want to perform stop for service PartitionedCache on node 1? (y/n) y
operation completed
----

[#shutdown-service]
==== Shutdown Service

operation completed
----

[#set-service]
==== Set Service

include::../../build/_output/docs-gen/set_service.adoc[tag=text]

See the https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/manage/oracle-coherence-mbeans-reference.html[Service MBean Reference]
for more information on the above attributes.

*Examples*

$ cohctl get services -o  jsonpath="$.items[?(@.name == 'PartitionedCache')]..['nodeId','name','threadCountMin']"
["2","PartitionedCache",1,"1","PartitionedCache",1]
----

NOTE: The above shows that the `threadCountMin` is 1 for both nodes.

Set the `threadCountMin` to 10 for each service member.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl set service PartitionedCache -a threadCountMin -v 10 -c local

Selected service: PartitionedCache
Are you sure you want to set the value of attribute threadCountMin to 10 for all 2 nodes? (y/n) y
operation completed

$ cohctl get services -o  jsonpath="$.items[?(@.name == 'PartitionedCache')]..['nodeId','name','threadCountMin']"
["2","PartitionedCache",10,"1","PartitionedCache",10]
