= Securing CLI Access

== Securing CLI Access

The Coherence CLI accesses cluster information using the Management over REST endpoint for the cluster as described in the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/rest-reference/quick-start.html[Coherence documentation].

Coherence HTTP Management Server authentication and authorization are disabled by default but can be enabled as required as outlined below.

=== Enabling Basic Authentication

To enable basic authentication for Management over REST, please follow the instructions in the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/secure/securing-oracle-oracle-http-management-rest-server.html#GUID-816E45C4-2F52-4576-BC09-CF0B6E873CBA[basic authentication] section
of the Coherence documentation.

=== Enabling SSL Authentication

To enable SSL to provide authentication for Management over REST, please follow the instructions in the
https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.0/secure/securing-oracle-oracle-http-management-rest-server.html#GUID-7FC70A65-FC2F-4CBE-8F7D-7CBC3CDAA10A[SSL authentication]
section of the Coherence documentation.

=== Working with secured REST endpoints

If you have enabled basic authentication for your Management over REST endpoint, or you are connecting to a WebLogic Server cluster, you must
provide the `-U username` option on all `cohctl` commands.

To specify a password, you have the following options:

. Enter the password when prompted for, or
. Use the `-i` or `--stdin` option to read the password from standard in. (Useful for GitHub actions or automated processes)

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get members -U username
Enter password: *****
