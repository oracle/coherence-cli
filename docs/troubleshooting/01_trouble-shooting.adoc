== Troubleshooting Guide

The purpose of this page is to list troubleshooting guides and work-arounds for issues that you may run into when using the Coherence CLI.
This page will be updated and maintained over time to include common issues we see from customers.

[#bad]
=== Bad CPU type in executable on macOS

==== Problem

You receive a message similar to the following when trying to run the CLI on macOS:

[source,command]
----
/usr/local/bin/cohctl: Bad CPU type in executable
----

==== Solution

This is most likely caused by installing the incorrect macOS .pkg for your architecture.  E.g. you may have an AMD Mac and trying to install the
Apple Silicon version or visa-versa.

Refer to the <<docs/installation/01_installation.adoc,Coherence CLI Installation section>> to uninstall
`cohctl` and download the correct pkg for your architecture.

You can run the `uname -a` command from a terminal and the output will indicate which type of architecture you have. The last value on the line it will be either `x86_64` for AMD or `arm64` for M1.

**AMD Processor**

[source,command]
----
$ uname -a
Darwin ... RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
----

**Apple Silicon (M1) Processor**

[source,command]
----
$ uname -a
Darwin ... RELEASE_ARM64_T8101 arm64
----

NOTE: Output above has been truncated for brevity.

[#execute]
=== Cannot execute [Exec format error] on Linux

==== Problem

You receive a message similar to the following when trying to run the CLI on Linux:

[source,command]
----
cohctl: cannot execute [Exec format error]
----

==== Solution

This is most likely caused by installing the incorrect linux executable for your architecture.  E.g. you may have an AMD Linux machine and trying to use
the ARM version or visa-versa.

Refer to the <<docs/installation/01_installation.adoc,Coherence CLI Installation section>> to uninstall
`cohctl` and download the correct binary for your architecture.

[#jfr]
=== Null returned in JFR commands

==== Problem

You see something similar to the following when running Java Flight Recorder (JFR) commands, where there is a null
instead of the member number.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get jfrs -c local

null->
   No available recordings.
   Use JFR.start to start a recording.
null->
   No available recordings.
   Use JFR.start to start a recording.
----

==== Solution

Then this is a known issue. To resolve you should apply the most recent available
Coherence patch on version you are using to resolve this.

[#services]
=== Cannot find services with quotes in their names

==== Problem

You are unable to describe or query services with quotes in their names.

Some Coherence services may have quotes in their names, especially if they contain a scope which is
delimited by a colon, as in WebLogic Server.
In these cases when you want to specify a service name you must enclose the whole service name in single quotes.

For example, take a look at the services for this WebLogic Server instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl get services -c wls -U weblogic
Enter password: ********

SERVICE NAME                      TYPE              MEMBERS  STATUS HA  STORAGE  PARTITIONS
"ExampleGAR:PartitionedPofCache"  DistributedCache        4  NODE-SAFE        2         257
----

If we issue the following command you will see the error below.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl describe service "ExampleGAR:PartitionedPofCache" -c wls -U weblogic
Enter password: *******

Error: unable to find service with service name 'ExampleGAR:PartitionedPofCache'
----

==== Solution

You must surround any service names that have double quotes with single quotes.

[source,bash]
----
cohctl describe service '"ExampleGAR:PartitionedPofCache"' -c wls -U weblogic
Enter password: ******

SERVICE DETAILS
---------------
Name                                :  "ExampleGAR:PartitionedPofCache"
Type                                :  [DistributedCache]
Backup Count                        :  [1]
Backup Count After Writebehind      :  [1]
....

[#wls]
=== Issues adding correct cluster when WebLogic Server has multiple Coherence clusters

==== Problem

When adding a connection to a WebLogic Server environment with multiple Coherence clusters,
present, by default only the first cluster will be added.

In the example below we have a WebLogic Server environment with two Coherence clusters: CoherenceCluster and CoherenceCluster2.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl add cluster wls1 -U weblogic -u http://host:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters
Enter password: *****
Added cluster wls1 with type http and URL http://thost:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters

$ cohctl get clusters
CONNECTION  TYPE  URL                                                     VERSION      CLUSTER NAME       TYPE       CTX
wls1        http  http://host:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters   14.1.1.0.0   CoherenceCluster   WebLogic
----

==== Solution

You must supply the cluster name on the URL to add a specific cluster, rather than adding the default one found.

[source,bash]
----
$ cohctl add cluster wls2 -U weblogic -u http://hostname:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters/CoherenceCluster2
Enter password: ******
Added cluster wls2 with type http and URL http://hostname:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters/CoherenceCluster2

$ cohctl get clusters
CONNECTION  TYPE  URL                                                                            VERSION      CLUSTER NAME        TYPE        CTX
wls1        http  http://hostname:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters                    14.1.1.0.0   CoherenceCluster    WebLogic
wls2        http  http://hostname:7001/management/coherence/latest/clusters/CoherenceCluster2  14.1.1.0.0   CoherenceCluster2   WebLogic
