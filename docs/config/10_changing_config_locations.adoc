= Changing Config Locations

== Changing Config Locations

By default, the CLI creates a directory `.cohctl` off the users home to store connection information,
log files and various other information.

If you wish to change this directory from the default, you can use the following for each command.

[source,bash]
----
cohctl get clusters --config-dir /u01/config
----

You can also specify a different location for the `cohct.yaml` file that is generated.

[source,bash]
----
cohctl get clusters --config /u01/my-config.yaml
----

NOTE: It is recommended to leave these values as default unless you have a good reason to change them
as you would need to specify the `--config` option on each command execution.
